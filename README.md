# RamScoutAI

Local web app that auto-scouts an FRC **match video** from a YouTube link.

Paste a recorded FRC match VOD (not a live stream). RamScoutAI:

1. Reads **teams and scores from the video** — YouTube title/description plus the on-screen scorebug
2. Downloads the VOD and tracks robots onto that year’s field image
3. Draws each robot with a bumper PNG and its team number
4. Estimates hub dwells, defense, collection, and climb attempts from motion

[The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/) is **optional**. If you paste a TBA key, nicknames and official extras are merged in. Scores from the broadcast still win when they can be read.

Action counts are **heuristics**. Confirm anything you put on a pick list.

## Run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Click **Try a sample match** to explore the UI without a download.

For better tracking, drop a **robot-trained** Ultralytics `.pt` in the project folder or `models/` (for example `robot.pt`). Default COCO / RT-DETR weights will follow people and other objects — the UI warns when that happens. Weight files are gitignored; do not commit them.

A full YouTube run needs network access. A TBA auth key (`TBA_AUTH_KEY` or the form field) is optional: when present, RamScoutAI resolves the match from the title or YouTube video id, then merges nicknames, `score_breakdown`, and Zebra tracks. Event key / match key fields override auto-resolve. Without TBA, teams and scores still come from the VOD overlay.

If YouTube returns a bot / sign-in check (common on cloud VMs), export cookies from a signed-in browser to a Netscape `cookies.txt` and set `YTDLP_COOKIES=/path/to/cookies.txt`, or run the app on your laptop where `yt-dlp` can use browser cookies. Title metadata still loads via oEmbed when the download is blocked.

## Next year’s game

Game art and timing live in year files, not in the UI:

1. Copy [`ramscout/games/2026.json`](ramscout/games/2026.json) to `ramscout/games/2027.json`
2. Add a top-down field PNG at [`web/fields/2027.png`](web/fields/2026.png) (match the real field aspect ratio, about 2:1)
3. Update `length_in`, `width_in`, auto/endgame timing, overlay crop bands, and `landmarks` so Hub/Tower dots sit on the new art
4. Review [`ramscout/events.py`](ramscout/events.py) and [`ramscout/field.py`](ramscout/field.py) for new scoring locations (Hub/Tower names will change)

The YouTube title year selects the config automatically (`2027 … Qualification Match 4` → `2027.json`). If that year is missing, the newest shipped layout is used.

Robot icons are shared: [`web/robots/blue.png`](web/robots/blue.png) and [`web/robots/red.png`](web/robots/red.png). Team numbers are stamped on the bumper plates at draw time.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Layout

- [`app.py`](app.py) — FastAPI server
- [`ramscout/`](ramscout/) — ingest, overlay OCR, TBA merge, tracking, events
- [`ramscout/games/`](ramscout/games/) — per-year field config
- [`web/fields/`](web/fields/) — field PNGs
- [`web/robots/`](web/robots/) — robot icon PNGs
- [`legacy/frc_live_scout.py`](legacy/frc_live_scout.py) — original PyQt desktop experiment

## Limits

- Wide, mostly fixed cameras work best
- Scorebug OCR needs a readable graphic; title/description is the backup
- Climb detection is “stayed on the Tower in endgame”, not rung level
- Hub candidates are low-speed dwells next to the Hub, not counted fuel
